This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the `renderItem` function is called repeatedly for the same item, leading to performance issues and unexpected behavior. This often happens when the `keyExtractor` function is not properly implemented or when the data source is updated frequently. The symptoms include slow scrolling, duplicated items, or incorrect item rendering.
